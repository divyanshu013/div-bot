# Div Bot
My personal alter ego living on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DivAlterEgo/).

## Configuration
You need to add `secret` and `page_access_token` to the `.env` file in the root directory. If you're deploying on cloud you might have to set environment variables to your app in the settings of your hosting provider.

The bot will echo your message back or reply with a predefined structured message for `generic` keyword. Needs a lot of improvement but this project can serve as a good starting point for any messenger bot.

Happy Hacking! :fire:
